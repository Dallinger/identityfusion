# Description

The `identityfusion` module turns an HTML input into an interactive
widget that administers the [Dynamic Identity Fusion Index (DIFI)](http://www2.uned.es/pspp/measures/difi/index.htm) 
[1], which assesses the degree to which the user's own identity
fuses with a group identity. The widget consists of a circle labeled
"Me" which can be dragged or moved using buttons to overlap a circle
which represents the group.

Two values are recorded:

1. Distance
2. Overlap

index: A new continuous measure of identity fusion for web-based 
questionnaires. *Social Science Computer Review*, 34(2), 215-228.

# Usage

To use the widget, create an HTML input with a name:

```
<input name="DIFI" id="DIFI" />
```

Then include the library and create a new DIFIInput instance:

```
<script src="identityfusion.js"></script>
<script>
  var el = document.getElementById('DIFI');
  new identityfusion.DIFIInput(el, {
    groupLabel: 'USA'
  });
</script>
```

Instantiating the DIFIInput will replace the original input
with two hidden inputs named `DIFI_distance` and `DIFI_overlap`
(with the original name as the prefix).

See `dist/demo.html` for an example.

# Options

Several options can be specified in the second parameter
when constructing a DIFIInput:

* `meLabel`: The label for the circle representing the user. (Default: `Me`)
* `groupLabel`: The label for the circle representing the group. (Default: `Group`)
* `groupImage`: URL for an image to be shown as the background of the group circle. (Default: none)
